# Introduction

Welcome to the *interactive PID control course** from UT Austin! This isn't just another set of lecture notes—it's a complete **hands-on learning laboratory** where you'll master PID control through **live coding, real-time experiments, and interactive problem-solving**.

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

By the end of this interactive course, you'll be able to:
- ✅ **Design and implement** discrete-time PID controllers in Python
- ✅ **Understand intuitively** how P, I, D components affect system behavior  
- ✅ **Apply professional tuning methods** (Ziegler-Nichols, manual tuning)
- ✅ **Handle real-world challenges** like saturation, noise, and disturbances
- ✅ **Analyze performance** with quantitative metrics (rise time, overshoot, settling time)
