## 📚 Course Structure

This course is organized into 5 interactive lectures:

### **📖 [Lecture 1: Introduction to Control Systems](lecture1.ipynb)**
Learn the fundamentals of control systems, open-loop vs closed-loop systems, and feedback control.

### **🔢 [Lecture 2: Mathematical Modeling](lecture2.ipynb)**
Understand how to model dynamic systems using transfer functions and analyze system responses.

### **⚙️ [Lecture 3: Introduction to PID Control](lecture3.ipynb)**
Dive into PID control theory and implement your first PID controller in Python.

### **🎛️ [Lecture 4: PID Tuning Methods](lecture4.ipynb)**
Learn various tuning methods including Ziegler-Nichols and manual tuning techniques.

### **🚀 [Lecture 5: Advanced Topics](lecture5.ipynb)**
Handle real-world challenges like saturation, noise, and anti-windup techniques.
